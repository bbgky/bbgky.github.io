In the previous post, the content of the webpage is further processed to *bag of words* format, which is able for machine-learning. The algorithm chosen for the *bag of words* with labels is `RandomForestClassifier`from `sklearn.ensemble`. The code and the results are in my [github][1].

Use `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn.preprocessing` to transform labels into integers. Use `cross_val_score` from `sklearn.cross_validation` to evaluate the forest. `f1_score` from `sklearn.metrics` evaluate the accuracy of each class.

To visualize the data, `TSNE` is used to reduce data dimension.
The color used for multiple classes is `seaborn.color_palette("hls",12)`. Details of how to use `color_palette` can be found in `seaborn`'s [document][2].
