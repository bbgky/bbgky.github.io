In the previous post, I listed the tools in bash to do the ETL to webpages. In this post, i will summarize the method using ipython notebook to do the webpage classification by machine-learning.  

The first part of code and results are in my [github][1], and  I put most of the notes and comment in the notebook file, so I may not repeat it here.

In this part, the machine-learning algorithm has not been applied. It is a process to transform the text file into a format that can be used for machine-learning. The important packages used here are `pandas`, `numpy`, `TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text` and `nltk.corpus`.

`pandas.drop` and `pandas.join` is frequently used to modify the dataframe. `numpy.unique` and `numpy.argsort`is frequently used to get the statistics and plotting.

`matplotlib.pyplot` is widely used for plotting. and `matplotlib.cm` is used for plotting color. `matshow` is used for plotting the correlation matrix. In this code,   color *YlGn* is used for the correlation figure. More other options can be found in the [matplotlib][2].
