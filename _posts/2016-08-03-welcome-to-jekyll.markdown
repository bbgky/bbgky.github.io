I am testing how to include an image in a post:

![A test image](/assets/ScreenShot.png)

What I did is creating a directory called `assets` and put the images in it. It seems working! But I am not sure how to adjust the size of the image yet.

Here I am testing the support for code snippets, which is a simple Python code:

{% highlight python %}

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

{% endhighlight %}

After the testing, i am going to update a post of what i learned during the CDIPS workshop.
